# PPRO

We are given a function / algorithm findMaxProfit() that can find the maximum profit when given an array of stock prices, and buy and sell once, with time complexity O(n), additional space complexity O(1). The buy must occur before the sell (meaning no short sell is allowed).

findMaxProfit() will return the maximum profit, and the buy and sell point (as indexes into the array). Example: { 7, 1, 5, 3, 6, 4 } meaning max profit is (5-1)+(6-3) = 7, and buy on day 2, sell on day 3. (day in the description is also 0 index based).
